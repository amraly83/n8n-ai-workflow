# Product Context: AI-Powered n8n Workflow Generator

## 1. Problem Statement

Creating n8n workflows, while powerful, can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially for users who are not deeply familiar with n8n's JSON structure or the intricacies of its various nodes. Users often:

*   Struggle to translate their high-level automation ideas into concrete n8n workflow logic.
*   Spend significant time manually configuring nodes and connections.
*   Find it challenging to debug and iterate on complex workflow JSON.
*   Require a technical understanding that can be a barrier for non-developers or less technical users.

This project aims to solve these problems by providing an intuitive, AI-driven interface that abstracts away the complexities of direct n8n JSON manipulation.

## 2. Ideal User Experience & Desired Outcomes

The ideal user experience is one of effortless creation and empowerment. Users should feel like they have a highly intelligent assistant that understands their automation needs and translates them into functional n8n workflows with minimal friction.

**Desired Outcomes:**

*   **Simplicity:** Users can describe their desired workflow in simple, natural language.
*   **Speed:** Workflow generation is significantly faster than manual creation.
*   **Accessibility:** Non-technical users can create powerful n8n automations without needing to learn the n8n JSON structure.
*   **Accuracy:** The AI agent generates correct and efficient n8n workflow JSON.
*   **Confidence:** Users trust the platform to produce reliable workflows.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Generated workflows are easily importable into their n8n instances.
*   **Premium Feel:** The application's design and interactions reinforce a sense of quality and professionalism.

**Key User Journeys (High-Level):**

1.  **New User Onboarding & First Workflow:**
    *   User signs up for the service.
    *   User is guided to the workflow creation interface.
    *   User types a description of a simple workflow (e.g., "When I receive an email with 'invoice' in the subject, save the attachment to Google Drive and send me a Slack message.").
    *   The AI agent processes the request and presents the n8n JSON.
    *   User copies the JSON and successfully imports it into their n8n instance.
    *   User experiences the "aha!" moment of seeing their described workflow function correctly.

2.  **Existing User Creating a Complex Workflow:**
    *   User logs into their dashboard.
    *   User navigates to create a new workflow.
    *   User describes a more complex multi-step workflow involving conditional logic, multiple app integrations, and data transformations.
    *   The AI agent might ask clarifying questions if the initial description is ambiguous (though the primary interaction is via a single webhook request/response for this version).
    *   The agent generates the complex n8n JSON.
    *   User reviews the JSON (optional, for advanced users) and imports it.

3.  **User Managing Account:**
    *   User navigates to their account settings.
    *   User updates their profile information or manages their subscription tier.

## 3. Key User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive Interaction:** The primary input method (plain text to the agent) should feel natural and require no special syntax or commands.
*   **Clear Feedback:** The application should clearly indicate the status of workflow generation and provide the output in an easily accessible format.
*   **Minimal Cognitive Load:** Users should not have to think about the underlying n8n structure; the AI handles that complexity.
*   **Delightful Design:** The UI should be aesthetically pleasing and contribute to a positive user experience.
