# Project Brief: AI-Powered n8n Workflow Generator

## 1. Project Vision

To create a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that empowers users to generate fully functioning n8n workflows by describing their requirements in plain text to an AI agent. The application aims to simplify and accelerate the n8n workflow creation process.

## 2. Core Requirements

*   **AI Agent Interaction:** Users interact with an AI agent by providing plain text descriptions of their desired n8n workflow.
*   **Workflow Generation:** The AI agent processes the user's input and generates the complete n8n workflow JSON, ready for import into n8n.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure sign-in and sign-up functionality.
*   **User Dashboard:** A personalized space for users to manage their generated workflows and account.
*   **User Account Management:** Functionality for users to manage their profile and subscription (if applicable).
*   **Webhook Integration:** Agent interaction will occur via sending a webhook API call and receiving the final response (n8n JSON) via a webhook response.

## 3. User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX)

*   **Premium UI:** Modern, minimalist, sleek, and premium-looking design.
*   **User-Friendly UX:** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
