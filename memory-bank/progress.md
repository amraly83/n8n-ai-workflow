# Progress: AI-Powered n8n Workflow Generator

## 1. Overall Project Status

*   **Current Phase:** Core Application & Infrastructure Setup.
*   **Status:** In Progress.
*   **Summary:** The foundational Memory Bank files have been created. The Next.js project (`n8n-ai-workflow-generator`) has been initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, `src/` directory, and `@/*` import alias. The next steps involve setting up Shadcn/ui, Prisma, and NextAuth.js.

## 2. Implemented & Working Functionalities

*   Basic Next.js project structure created.
*   Memory Bank core files established.
*   Shadcn/ui initialized and configured in the `n8n-ai-workflow-generator` project (base color: Neutral, `utils.ts` created, `globals.css` updated).
*   Core Shadcn/ui components installed: button, input, card, dialog, dropdown-menu, navigation-menu, sheet, sonner.
*   **UI Fixes:**
    *   Corrected "Learn More" button styling in `HeroSection.tsx` to ensure visibility against dark background (added `bg-transparent`).
    *   Updated "Sign In" and "Sign Up" button links in `StickyHeader.tsx` to point to `/api/auth/signin` for correct NextAuth.js redirection (Note: This will need to be revisited now that Clerk is the auth system).
*   **Authentication System & Build Fixes:**
    *   **Aligned with Clerk Authentication:** Based on new user feedback, the authentication system is being aligned with Clerk.
        *   **Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`):** Reverted to use `ClerkProvider` and standard Clerk UI components (`<SignInButton>`, `<UserButton>`, etc.), removing `SupabaseAuthProvider`.
        *   **Dashboard Layout (`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/layout.tsx`):** Refactored to use Clerk's `useUser()` and `useClerk()` hooks for user information and sign-out functionality. Removed client-side redirection logic previously based on Supabase auth.
        *   **Sticky Header (`src/components/layout/StickyHeader.tsx`):** Refactored to use Clerk's `<SignedIn>`, `<SignedOut>`, `<UserButton>`, `<SignInButton>`, and `<SignUpButton>` components, removing Supabase auth logic and custom modals.
    *   **Resolved Prerender Errors:** The error `Error: useSupabaseAuth must be used within a SupabaseAuthProvider` (occurring on `/dashboard/create` and `/`) is now resolved by ensuring the root layout, dashboard layout, and sticky header consistently use Clerk for authentication.

## 3. Components/Features Left to Build/Refine (High-Level Initial List)

**Core Application & Infrastructure:**

*   Directory structure and basic project configuration (further refinements as needed).
*   ESLint & Prettier setup (verify and customize if necessary).
*   Prisma initialized:
    *   Prisma CLI installed.
    *   `prisma/schema.prisma` created with User, Account, Session, VerificationToken, and Workflow models.
    *   `.env` file created (and confirmed to be in `.gitignore`).
    *   Prisma Client installed.
    *   Prisma Client generated successfully to `node_modules/.prisma/client` with explicit output path in schema.
*   Authentication setup (NextAuth.js with chosen providers):
    *   `next-auth` and `@auth/prisma-adapter` packages installed.
    *   `bcryptjs` and `@types/bcryptjs` installed for password hashing.
    *   `src/lib/prisma.ts` created to instantiate Prisma Client.
    *   `prisma/schema.prisma` User model updated with `hashedPassword` field. (Note: `prisma db push` and `prisma generate` encountered environment issues that user needs to resolve).
    *   NextAuth.js API route at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` updated:
        *   Added `CredentialsProvider` for email/password sign-in.
        *   Implemented `authorize` function for credentials validation.

## 4. Known Issues, Bugs, or Areas Needing Attention

*   **Addressed:** "Learn More" button in Hero Section had white text on a white background. (Fixed by making button background transparent).
*   **Addressed:** Sign In and Sign Up buttons were not functional, only offered GitHub, and led to separate pages.
    *   Implemented modal-based Sign In and Sign Up using `SignInModal.tsx` and `SignUpModal.tsx`.
    *   `StickyHeader.tsx` now triggers these modals.
    *   Added `CredentialsProvider` to NextAuth.js configuration, so modals offer email/password options alongside GitHub.
    *   Added an API route for email/password registration (`/api/auth/register`).
*   **Redesigned (Iterative):** "How It Works" section was first changed to a vertical alternating layout, then further refined to a horizontal timeline layout.
*   **Added:** FAQ section with accordion layout.
*   **Redesigned:** "Contact Us" section now features a centered form and no direct contact details.
*   **Adjusted:** Whitespace between header and hero section by removing top padding from main layout container in `page.tsx`.
*   **Enhanced:** Hero section design with subtle glows, gradient text, and improved button styling.
*   **Redesigned:** Pricing section layout to enhance visual distinction of plans, especially the featured tier.
*   **Redesigned:** Features section for a more "catchy" and modern presentation.
*   **Redesigned:** Sign-in and Sign-up modals for a more modern and user-friendly appearance.
*   **Added:** Foundational structure and placeholder pages for the user dashboard.
    *   Fixed an import error in `(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` by changing `useSession` (NextAuth) to `useSupabaseAuth`.
*   **Addressed:** Hydration mismatch error in FAQ accordion by adding `suppressHydrationWarning` to `AccordionTrigger`.
*   **Enhanced:** `StickyHeader.tsx` to display user navigation (avatar, dropdown with Dashboard/Logout) when authenticated, and Sign In/Up modals otherwise.
*   **Improved UX:** Added automatic redirection to `/dashboard` after successful email/password sign-in via `SignInModal.tsx`.
*   **Re-evaluation of Auth Components:** 
    *   The `SignInModal.tsx` and `SignUpModal.tsx` components are likely no longer needed due to `StickyHeader.tsx` now using Clerk's built-in UI components for sign-in/up. These custom modal files should be reviewed for deletion.
    *   The `StickyHeader.tsx` has been refactored for Clerk.
*   **Supabase Auth Artifacts Removal:** 
    *   `SupabaseAuthProvider.tsx` and `lib/supabaseClient.ts` should be reviewed for deletion.
    *   The auth check in `/api/generate-workflow/route.ts` (currently using Supabase) needs to be updated to use Clerk's server-side authentication (e.g., `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`).
*   **Addressed:** Various ESLint errors (unused variables, explicit any, unescaped entities) across multiple files to allow for a clean build.
*   **Implemented (Non-Streaming - Auth Needs Review):** Backend API route (`/api/generate-workflow`) to call the n8n agent webhook.
    *   **Authentication Re-enabled:** The authentication check (using `supabase.auth.getSession()`) within this API route has been restored. This ensures that user status is checked before processing the request, aligning with security best practices.
    *   **Note for Local Development:** Due to the ongoing Supabase Site URL mismatch, this API route will likely return a 401 Unauthorized error if called locally without a valid server-side session recognized for `localhost`.
    *   The route continues to use the shared `supabaseClient` due to unresolved environment issues with `@supabase/ssr` helpers.
*   **Implemented (Non-Streaming):** Frontend integration in `CreateWorkflowPage` to call the backend API, send prompt, and display returned n8n JSON or errors.
*   **Next.js Middleware & Session Handling:** (`src/middleware.ts`, `src/utils/supabase/middleware.ts`)
    *   Middleware is in place using `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` to protect `/dashboard` routes.
    *   Logging has been added to trace cookie and session status.
    *   **Core Issue Identified:** The middleware correctly attempts to validate sessions, but fails (`No session` reported) because the browser does not send Supabase cookies on requests to `http://localhost:3000`. This is due to the Supabase project's global "Site URL" being configured for a different domain (e.g., `db.appautomation.cloud`), causing Supabase to set cookies for that external domain, not `localhost`. The user cannot change this global Site URL due to other production projects.
    *   **Consequence:** Server-side page protection via this middleware will not function correctly in the local development environment under the current constraints. Access to `/dashboard` via UI remains blocked.
*   **Added:** Next.js Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) and a helper `src/utils/supabase/middleware.ts`. Both use `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` (with `getAll`/`setAll` cookie methods) to attempt server-side protection of `/dashboard` routes.
    *   Debug logs added to middleware. Redirect logic restored.
    *   **Addressed (Potentially):** Server logs previously indicated middleware consistently found "No session". This was likely due to the Supabase client in `middleware.ts` reading cookies from the original request (`req.cookies`) instead of the response object (`res.cookies`) returned by `updateSession` (which contains potentially updated session cookies).
    *   **Fix Applied:** `src/middleware.ts` was modified so the `createServerClient` instance (used for `getSession`) now reads cookies from `res.cookies`. This should allow it to correctly detect active sessions refreshed by `updateSession`. Further testing by the user is needed to confirm this resolves the dashboard access issue.
*   **Environmental Issue:** `prisma db push` failed due to database connection error. User needs to ensure PostgreSQL server is running. (This is now less relevant as Prisma for auth is removed, but still relevant if Prisma is used for other tables with Supabase DB).
*   **Environmental Issue:** `prisma generate` failed with EPERM error. User needs to resolve this. (This is now less relevant as Prisma for auth is removed. TypeScript errors related to `hashedPassword` in old NextAuth files are also irrelevant as those files are deleted).
*   **Addressed (Build Error):** Prerender errors on `/dashboard/create` and `/` (root page) related to `useSupabaseAuth` have been resolved by consistently implementing Clerk authentication across `app/layout.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/layout.tsx`, and `components/layout/StickyHeader.tsx`.
*   **Future Consideration:** Implement streaming response handling for the n8n webhook integration.
*   **Future Consideration:** Data fetching for `workflows` in the dashboard needs to be refactored to use `supabaseClient`.
*   **Ongoing Verification:** Hydration warnings in `ContactUsSection` and general layout still need verification after previous suppression attempts.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Deviations

*   No deviations from the initial plan so far. The current process aligns with the Genesis Engine protocol for establishing the Memory Bank.
